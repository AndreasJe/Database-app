<h1>"Changelog" </h1>

<p>
Ver 0.1 = Attempt to setup with MariaDB got shut down by a retarded handling of foreign keys in the system. <br>
Ver 0.2 = Installing driver, setting up postgres + pgadmin. Tried lots of different PGSQL PDO script, but none worked <br>
Ver 0.3 = Simple Postgres setup works for the initial Signup. Unfortunately it errors afterwards, since the ID doesnt auto increment.<br>
Ver 0.4 = ID fixed with SERIAL - Moved ID to buttom of tables to sort out problems with the order, when querying - Sign up and Login works.<br>
Ver 0.5 = Connection and setup somewhat functional - Signup, Login, Course Overview, Enrollment and a Chapter Overview has been added.<br>
<br>
